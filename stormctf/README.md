# CTFd-Theme-StormCTF
CTFd Theme for StormCTF (Updated a little bit for the newest version of CTFd)

### For Version 1.2.0

## Info
Redesigned CTFd template for [UIKit](https://getuikit.com). Colors are based off of StormCTF's Website. Mobile ready. Written by [Alex](https://twitter.com/offsec_ginger) for StormCTF 2018 at InfoSeCon 2018.

## Installation
* Copy `stormctf/` into your `CTFd/CTFd/themes` folder.
* Copy `plugins/challenges/assets/standard-challenge-modal.njk` to `CTFd/CTFd/plugins/challenges/assets/standard-challenge-modal.njk`
  * **THIS WILL OVERWRITE THE ORIGINAL. MAKE A BACKUP.**

### TO DO:
- [ ] Create njk's for different challenge types.
- [ ] Maybe redo the Graphs?
- [x] Wait for @ColdHeat to update to 2.0 so I can fix this all over again :stuck_out_tongue:
